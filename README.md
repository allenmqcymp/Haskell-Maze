# Haskell-Maze

# Motivation

This is the first assignment for ANU's 2017 Introduction to Programming course in Haskell. 

# Code 

All the code is (currently) in the Main.hs file. I will be adding additional functionality soon. This will be in the /src file.

The maze utilizes the CodeWorld API: 

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/codeworld-api-0.2.0.0/docs/CodeWorld.html

# Running

The easiest way to run is simply to copy and paste Main.hs into http://code.world/#haskell from which the program can be readily run
in the browser.
